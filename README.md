This project involves Arduino IDE, an ESP8266, NeoPixel strips, Google Home, Blynk, and IFTTT.
Voice command through google home travels to IFTTT, which sends a webhook to blynk which publishes it and sends it to the esp chip.

Start the blynk webhooks URL with your region (for ex. ny3). See region at bottom right corner of blynk.console < devices page.
